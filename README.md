* <b>Problem Statement: </b>Your friend is a chief architect, who is working on building a skyscraper, in Mumbai. The construction is in such a way that the floors will be constructed in other factories and they will be assembled. All the sizes will be distinct.
  The skyscraper needs to be constructed in N days with the following conditions :
  a)	Every day a floor is constructed in a separate factory of distinct size.
  b)	The floor with the larger size must be placed at the bottom of the building.
  c)	The floor with the smaller size must be placed at the top of the building.
  Note: A floor cannot be assembled in the building until all floors larger in size are placed.
  As a friend he wants you to build a small program that will help him analyze the construction process, to avoid manual work and errors.
  
* This project has 2 packages : 
   * <b>com.glproject2.driver</b>- this has the driver class. 
   * <b>com.glproject2.solution</b>- this has the class containing the contruction process code(STACK DS is used)

* Concepts :
   * <b>Data structures</b> - Essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs , each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem at hand. Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance. 
   * <b>DSA</b> - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically. Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.
   * <b>Stack</b> - Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
